# CreateARainbowEvent
A simple application that demonstrates click events using JS and jQuery with a group of colors. When colors are selected it is appended to the header and when clicked again, goes back into the original container in the order clicked. The title and color of the header can be changed with user input. Colors can also be saved within a card with the "Save to Card" button.
